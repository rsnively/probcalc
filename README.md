#Minesweeper Probability Calculator
Playing minesweeper with just a nudge in the right direction.

##Download
Visit [the Minesweeper Probability Calculator's GitHub page](https://github.com/rsnively/probcalc) to download a copy of the package, or to clone the repository. The repository contains all of the necessary java files required to run the program. It is recommended that a recent edition of the JDK is installed to ensure no problems arise during compilation or runtime. A runnable jar file (probcalc.jar) is also included in the package.

##Playing
The purpose of the game of Minesweeper is to uncover all of the cells in the game which do not contain a mine. If a mine is set off (by clicking on a square covering a mine) at any point in the game, you lose. Once uncovered, every safe square in the game provides clues as to the locations of the game's mines by informing the player how many of the surrounding eight cells are mines. Once the player has determined that a cell is a mine, he or she can right-click on the cell to flag it as dangerous.

The probability calculator marks each cell with the probability of that cell being a mine. While some of the probabilities are obvious, the solution can involve a system of equations of monstruous size, and often shows the player some smart decisions that are not necessarily intuitive.
